          Origin and growth In 1996 Jimmy Wales, a successful bond trader, moved
          to San Diego, California, to establish Bomis, Inc., a Web portal
          company. In March 2000 Wales founded Nupedia, a free online
          encyclopaedia, with Larry Sanger as editor in chief. Nupedia was
          organized like existing encyclopaedias, with an advisory board of
          experts and a lengthy review process.

          experts and a lengthy review process. By January 2001 fewer than two
          dozen articles were finished, and Sanger advocated supplementing
          Nupedia with an open-source encyclopaedia based on wiki software. On
          January 15, 2001, Wikipedia was launched as a feature of Nupedia.com,
          but, following objections from the advisory board, it was relaunched
          as an independent Web site a few days later. In its first year
          Wikipedia expanded to some 20,000 articles in 18 languages, including
          French, German, Polish, Dutch, Hebrew, Chinese, and Esperanto. In 2003
          Nupedia was terminated and its articles moved into Wikipedia.
